# Artificial-Intelligence-Algorithms-Report
A comprehensive collection of AI and ML algorithm implementations developed for the CMP4501 course. This repository includes search algorithms (DFS, BFS, UCS, A*), a constraint satisfaction Sudoku solver, Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for Tic-Tac-Toe, reinforcement learning agents (Q-Learning, Policy Iteration), and machine learning models such as Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Single Layer Perceptron. Each project focuses on building models from scratch using Python, emphasizing algorithmic understanding and decision-making processes.
